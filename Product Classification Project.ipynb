       "  'Description': 'Pizzelle (pronounced with ts sound, like \"pizza\") (singular pizzella) are traditional Italian waffle cookies made from flour, eggs, sugar, butter or vegetable oil, and flavoring (often vanilla, anise, or lemon zest). Pizzelle can be hard and crisp or soft and chewy depending on the ingredients and method of preparation. Pizzelle were originally made in Ortona, in the Abruzzo region of south-central Italy. The name comes from the Italian word for \"round\" and \"flat\" (pizze); this is also the meaning of the word pizza. Many other cultures have developed a pizzelle-type cookie as part of their culture (for example, the Norwegian Krumkake). It is known to be one of the oldest cookie. Pizzelle are known as ferratelle in the Lazio region of Italy. In Molise they may be called ferratelle, cancelle, or pizzelle. The cookie dough or batter is put into a pizzelle iron. The iron stamps a snowflake pattern onto both sides of the thin golden-brown cookie, which has a crisp texture once it is cooled. Pizzelle shaped into a cannolo and filled with an orange-almond crAme. Pizzelle are popular during Christmas and Easter. They are often found at Italian weddings, alongside other traditional pastries such as cannoli and traditional Italian cookies. It is also common for two pizzelle to be sandwiched with cannoli cream (ricotta blended with sugar) or hazelnut spread. Pizzelle, while still warm, can also be rolled using a wooden dowel to create cannoli shells.',\n",

Its 3.2ms seek time enables 45% more I/Os per second than the average 10K RPM drives can achieve. The Atlas 15K drive can sustain up to 75MB/sec data transfer rate and is ideal for use in high-performance workstations, NAS and SAN environments, OLTP applications, enterprise servers and data mining applications. The drive is equipped with Maxtor-developed Ultra320 SCSI and is backwards compatible with all prior versions of SCSI. The Ultra320 interface includes MaxAdapt, a closed-loop method of improving signal quality by amplifying the fundamental frequency of the signal in the receiver while filtering noise and other undesirable components. MaxAdapt allows the drive to adapt to changing system conditions and components, which translates into lower error rates, easier integration, and increased bus efficiency for optimal system performance.

She was also active in the Women's suffrage movement and the Temperance movement. (wikipedia.org) Review of the title: Comfort is a word seldom associated with religious faith by those who are not Christians. Doesn't religion make people uncomfortable with its demands? Isn't life more comfortable when we just live the way we want? Who needs to worry about a judgmental God watching our every move? Even the word Jesus is enough to cause people to squirm in their seats. However, for many Christians the words Jesus and comfort are inextricably linked. In her classic work, God of All Comfort, Hannah Whitall Smith describes why faith in the Christian God leads to a comfort and joy that cannot be found elsewhere. Without Christ, life is little more than living through doubt, fear, and anxiety. In her inspirational work, Smith reminds the reader of the reality of God's promises to his people. With Christ, doubt, fear, and anxiety are obsolete feelings. (Andrew Hanson)\",\n",

To lift the canopy, it is as easy as using the polished, metal hand crank to wind the steel cable inside the pole and open the umbrella. No pushing, lifting, or pulling ropes to open the canopy. The umbrella has a auto-tilt, so you can adjust the shade on either side (180 degrees). The canopy is made from your choice of Sunbrella fabric, one of the best outdoor fabrics, and resists water, fading and mildew. Galtech umbrellas are made to enjoy for years to come, not just one season.',\n",

Having an Ex Pen in the family room allows the puppy to be with them when they watch TV and when their other house dogs are loose in the room. The Ex Pen gives the puppy the feeling of being part of the family pack with minimal interaction with the other dogs.

It's also a great way to show other dogs in the house that the new puppy is now part of the family pack. When puppies are raised like this, they will stay in an Ex Pen as an adult dog. This exercise pen is durable and affordable. Exercise Pens are good playing ground for your Pets whether indoors or outdoors. This exercise pen is made of Acri-Lock acrylic coated gold zinc for long lasting protection. It has a secure double latch door access to make your pet secure.

CLICK HERE for Service Dog Patches Girth Measurements: Girth S 28\"-33\" Girth M 31\"-36\" Girth L 33\"-40\" How To Measure Your Dog Find your dog\\'s girth, which is the widest point of your dog\\'s chest and rib cage area. Harness size measurements are based on girth, which can vary according to breed. Some dogs, like Boxers, are more deep-chested than others. It is important to accurately measure your dog\\'s girth for the best size possible. 1) Stand over your dog and place one end of the tape measure on his spine, just above the widest part of his rib cage. 2) With your other hand, wrap the tape measure behind his front legs and around his body, going underneath the widest part of his rib cage. Place this end next to the beginning of the tape. Put your thumb on the number that meets up with the beginning of the tape measure. The higher number is the girth measurement. 3) Order the proper harness size based on your dog\\'s girth measurement. If your dog\\'s measurement falls between two different sizes, order the larger size if want to allow room to grow.',\n",

       "  'Description': \"Various - 1000 Nadelstiche: 1-CD with 38-page booklet, 24 tracks. Playing time approx. 59 mns.We proudly present the second volume of our successful anthology '1000 Nadelstiche - Amerikaner & Briten singen Deutsch'. All volumes in this series are now based on styles or themes, but of course there will be no overlaps with Volume 1, BCD 16366.All of the British or American singers, who experimented in Volume 2 with German recording, had their roots in Country music. All were stars in their home countries, starting to get international acclaim for their music. Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Lynn Anderson, Bobby Bare, Jim Ed Brown, Tommy Overstreet, Stu Phillips and Frank Ifield have been stars in their home countries for decades, but their German recordings are virtually unknown. The original singles are rare and thus quite valuable, and almost all of the titles in this collection appear for the first time on CD. It's a rare treat, not only for collectors, but for country music lovers.FRANK IFIELD: So leicht lernt man das Jodeln JIM ED BROWN: Mikey LYNN ANDERSON: Ich hab einen Boy in Germany JODY MILLER: Was fur ein Tag BOBBY BARE: Alle glauben dass ich glucklich bin JOHNNY CASH: Kleine Rosmarie WANDA JACKSON: Ein Herz verliert, ein Herz gewinnt WILLIE NELSON: Little Darling ANITA KERR SINGERS: Cowboys Heimweh STU PHILLIPS: Ol' Kentucky TOMMY OVERSTREET: Etwas Gluck gehort dazu TOMMY OVERSTREET: Sie ging fort ANITA KERR SINGERS: Jenny Darling FRANK IFIELD: I Remember You JIM ED BROWN: Renate und Karin LYNN ANDERSON: Morgen wirst du wieder bei mir sein JOHNNY CASH: Besser so, Jenny Joe WANDA JACKSON: Was hat man denn bloss von so einem Mann ANITA KERR SINGERS: Sentimental Cowboy BOBBY BARE: Rosalie JODY MILLER: Liebelei hat keinen Sinn STU PHILLIPS: Irgendwann sagt man goodbye WILLIE NELSON: Whisky Walzer ANITA KERR SINGERS: Bye Bye Baby\",\n",

       "  'Name': 'A Unified Theory of Collective Action and Social Change',\n",
       "  'Description': 'The notion that groups form and act in ways that respond to objective, external costs and benefits has long been the key to accounting for social change processes driven by collective action. Yet this same notion seems to fall apart when we try to explain how collectivities emerge out of the choices of individuals. This book overcomes that dilemma by offering an analysis of collective action that, while rooted in individual decision making, also brings out the way in which objective costs and benefits can impede or foster social coordination. The resulting approach enables us to address the causes and consequences of collective action with the help of the tools of modern economic theory. To illustrate this, the book applies the tools it develops to the study of specific collective action problems such as clientelism, focusing on its connections with economic development and political redistribution; and wage bargaining, showing its economic determinants and its relevance for the political economy of the welfare state. \"Medina\\'s study is a great step forward in the analytics of collective action. He shows the inadequacies of currently standard models and shows that straightforward revisions reconcile rational-choice and structural viewpoints. It will influence all future work.\" -Kenneth Arrow, Stanford University \"Olson, Schelling, and now Medina. A Unified Theory deepens our understanding of collective action and contributes to the foundations of our field. A major work.\" -Robert H. Bates, Harvard University \"Medina thinks that the main problem of social action is not whether or not to cooperate but how to do it. To this end he has produced an imaginative approach to analyzing strategic coordination problems that produces plausible predictions in a range of circumstances.\" -John Ferejohn, Stanford University Luis Fernando Medina is Associate Professor in the Department of Politics at the University of Virginia.',\n",

Under desk consideration: Standard Pedal Exerciser pedal height tops out at 13\". Isokinetics\\' Deluxe Pedal Exerciser is best option for under desk use, with a pedal top out height of 10.5\". Direct from manufacturer pricing means you save more. 1 year warranty from Isokinetics Inc. Now comes with Dycem anti-slip strips to place under the feet to help solve a common problem of slipping on smooth floors. Made of high quality 1\" chrome-plated steel tubing, with 4 flat-bottom rubber feet to grip the floor, and adjustable pedal straps to keep your feet in place. Our model IS NOT a \"knock-down\" model which requires the customer to assemble the frame and may be less rigid. Ours is a single-piece, welded, solid construction, fully assembled frame. Just insert and tighten the resistance knob and it is ready to use. Appropriate for elderly exercise. Often used for shoulder or knee rehabilitation as it provides a consistent muscle motion, strengthening arm or leg muscles and keeping the joints loose. This basic exerciser provides a low level aerobic workout: For a more vigorous workout, see our Deluxe or Magnetic models. Can be used for upper body exercises by placing it on a table and using your arms, or for lower body exercises placed on the floor and pedaled with your feet. At 5 pounds, it is easy to move around and store. Sit with legs at close to a 90 degree angle. Start your exercise program slowly and gradually work up to 20 minutes of exercise at least 3 times a week. Please note that like all pedal exercisers of this design, the resistance knob housing can become hot after using vigorously, so take care when touching after heavy use. We found it does not heat up much when used at lower resistance levels. ALWAYS consult a physician before beginning this, or any other, exercise program. For more rigorous needs, consider our Deluxe or Magnetic models.',\n",

Nevilles Haze Flowering Times Indoors: should be started under 12 hours of lights. The earliest will finish in 14 weeks (25%). Those that take much longer than this are usually discarded as not practical Outdoors should be grown in the Tropics and started just before the onset of autumn. Yields are surprisingly good the longer flowering time is usually compensated with extra large yields, both in and outdoors. Not for the novice smoker or grower.

       "  'Description': \"The Croll chest ascender is unmatched for efficiency on fixed lines. Compact and lightweight, (30% lighter than the origianl Croll) it does not interfere with progression. The stainless steel wear plate improves durability by reinforcing the rope friction zone. The cam is stainless steel also. Compact, lightweight chest rope clamp Used with the ASCENSION handled rope clamp for ascending a rope Toothed cam with self-cleaning slot optimizes performance under any conditions (e.g. rope that is icy, muddy, etc.). The stainless steel cam has better resistance to corrosion The rope channel is reinforced with stainless steel for greater durability Catch is opened by pinching for easy, simple manipulation Lower hole is angled to keep the device flat Upper hole for attaching a shoulder strap to keep the rope clamp in position Specifications Reference: B16AAA Rope diameter: 8-11 mm Certification(s): CE EN 567, CE EN 12 841 type B Weight: 85 g For technical notes click here . There has been some controversy over information on an Italian website. Here is Petzl's offiicial response: . Following the recent publication of 2013 CROLL tests on an Italian website ( http://www.sns-cai.it/item/test-sul-crol-petzl-di-recente-produzione ),Petzl would like to remind users of the following facts: The new 2013CROLLcomplies with the requirements of the EN567 standard when used with authorized ropes types (8-11mm). The CROLL withstands 5 consecutive static pulls of 4kN. During these tests the clamp was never pulled out. We have tested the new 2013 CROLL with a large selection of ropes in slow pull static testing. The forces at which the sheath of the rope tore were: 5kN for the 8mm, 6-7 kN on the other diameters. During productdevelopmentand production, we have conducted many dynamic tests (shock load with a rigid mass near an anchor point and extreme destructive tests with a guided mass on worn out ropes of large diameter) -- in these tests the clamp was never pulled out and the sheath of the rope was torn. In normal use, the CROLL should never encounter such high forces, but it is critical that this (and all Petzl PPE) be used in accordance with the technical notice : http://www.petzl.com/files/all/technical-notice/Sport/B16-CROLL.pdf Petzl will contactthe authors of these testsas soon as possible to exchange information.\",\n",

       "  'Description': 'A New York Review Books OriginalIn 1905 the young Swiss writer Robert Walser arrived in Berlin to join his older brother Karl, already an important stage-set designer, and immediately threw himself into the vibrant social and cultural life of the city. Berlin Stories collects his alternately celebratory, droll, and satirical observations on every aspect of the bustling German capital, from its theaters, cabarets, paintersa galleries, and literary salons, to the metropolitan street, markets, the Tiergarten, rapid-service restaurants, and the electric tram. Originally appearing in literary magazines as well as the feuilleton sections of newspapers, the early stories are characterized by a joyous urgency and the generosity of an unconventional guide. Later pieces take the form of more personal reflections on the writing process, memories, and character studies. All are full of counter-intuitive images and vignettes of startling clarity, showcasing a unique talent for whom no detail was trivial, at grips with a city diving headlong into modernity.',\n",

THE HISTORY BEHIND THE STYLE Red Wings Classic Work boots were designed and built to withstand the daily rigors of the work day on the farm and in the factory. The lightweight crepe sole featured a minimal tread design to reduce the mud that would cling to a farmers boots but still provide the underfoot comfort the work day required. Red Wing would brand the crepe sole as the Traction Tred sole. These classic boots featured a moc toe design. The name came from the word moccasin, the Algonquian Indian word for shoe. This combination of the u-shaped moc toe leather upper and the white crepe sole would become the iconic boot style for the Red Wing brand. It is one of the oldest Red Wing styles and a best-seller. OIL-TANNED LEATHER S.B. Foot Tanning Co. is best known for oil-tanned leather which is used to build a variety of timeless Red Wing styles. This leather is water, stain and perspiration resistant, and has a more natural look and feel because less finishing materials have been applied, allowing its natural beauty to shine through. Oil-tanned leather is exceptionally durable and has been used to build countless work boots throughout Red Wings 108+ year history. Leather: Copper Rough & Tough Leather Outsole: Traction Tred Cushion Crepe Wedge Insole: Leather Hardware: Dark Gun Metal Eyelets Construction: Goodyear Welt Last: 45 Lace: 80\" Chestnut Leather Lace A new pair of Red Wing Heritage boots should fit comfortably tight on your foot, with enough room to freely wiggle your toes. Over time the full grain leather upper, leather footboard and cork midsole mold to your feet, creating an enduring and customized fit over time with each wear.',\n",

The Half Rack also has a number system for quick adjustments. Additionally, the Oval Footplates added to the four corners of the structure allow the machine to be fixed to the ground, reducing wobble at heavy weight loads. You can customise your Workbench Half Rack to include the Utility bench (PTWBUB16), Lat Tower Option (PTWBLTO16), 190lb Weight Stack Set, Dip Bar and 300lb Olympic Weight Set (each sold separately). Please note: This rack requires a 7ft barbell (not included).

High quality embroideries adorn the shoulders of Gi and the outside leg area of the pants. The Estilo logo is subtly placed at the back of the neck and the bottom of the right shin area of the pants. A small embroidery is placed on the front of the jacket with the text \"Estilo 5.0\". A sublimated neck yoke lining adds a high quality detail to the new Estilo 5.0, with new unique woven taping to line the inside of the sleeve cuffs, ankle cuffs and the bottom of the jackets. The new Estilo 5.0 jacket features a new unique Y shaped jacket vent. The Y vent we feel helps to provide a better fit along the base of the jacket.Features include: - 550GSM Pearl Weave Jacket - 12oz Canvas Pants - Embroidered Tatami Logos - Embroidered Estilo Logos - Inside Sublimated Neck Lining - Woven Tape Lining Cuffs and Base Of Jacket - New Unique Y-Jacket Vents',\n",

       "  'Description': \"Muhammad Yunus set up the Grameen Bank in his home country of Bangladesh with a loan of just 17, to lend tiny amounts of money to the poorest of the poor - those to whom no ordinary bank would lend. Most of his customers - as they still are - were illiterate women, wanting to set up the smallest imaginable village enterprises. It was his conviction that this new system of 'micro-credit', lending even such small sums, would give such people the spark of initiative needed to pull themselves out of poverty. Today, Yunus's system of micro-credit is practised around the world in some 60 countries, including the US, Canada and France. His Grameen Bank is now a billion-pound business. It is acknowledged by world leaders and by the World Bank to be a fundamental weapon in the fight against poverty. Banker to the Poor is Yunus's enthralling story of how he did it: how the terrible famine in Bangladesh in 1974 focused his ideas on the need to enable its victims to grow more food; how he overcame the sceptics in many governments and among traditional economic thinking; and how he saw his micro-credit extended even outside the Third World into credit unions in the West. Such is the importance of his book that HRH the Prince of Wales has contributed a Foreword in which he hails 'a remarkable man [who] spoke the greatest good sense'.\",\n",

       "  'Description': '\"There are lives lost in this book, and there are lives saved, too, if salvation means a young man or woman begins to feel deserving of a place on the planet. . . . What could be more soul-satisfying? These are the most influential professionals most of us will ever meet. The effects of their work will last forever.\" -from the foreword by Anna QuindlenNow depicted in a bestselling book and a feature film, the Freedom Writers phenomenon came about in 1994 when Erin Gruwell stepped into Room 203 and began her first teaching job out of college. Long Beach, California, was still reeling from the deadly violence that erupted during the Rodney King riots, and the kids in Erin\\'s classroom reflected the anger, resentment, and hopelessness of their community. Undaunted, Erin fostered an educational philosophy that valued and promoted diversity, tolerance, and communication, and in the process, she transformed her students\\' lives, as well as her own. Erin Gruwell and the Freedom Writers went on to establish the Freedom Writers Foundation to replicate the success of Room 203 and provide all students with hope and opportunities to realize their academic potential. Since then, the foundation has trained more than 150 teachers in the United States and Canada. Teaching Hope unites the voices of these Freedom Writer teachers, who share uplifting, devastating, and poignant stories from their classrooms, stories that provide insight into the struggles and triumphs of education in all of its forms.Mirroring an academic year, these dispatches from the front lines of education take us from the anticipation of the first day to the disillusionment, challenges, and triumphs of the school year. These are the voices of teachers who persevere in the face of intolerance, rigid administration, and countless other challenges, and continue to reach out and teach those who are deemed unteachable. Their stories inspire everyone to make a difference in the world around them.From the Trade Paperback edition.',\n",

Unlike other brands, Liberon cleans the steel wool after manufacture to remove the oil used in the manufacturing process. Because the steel wool is virtually oil-free, it can be used without fear of contamination. The 0000 grade steel wool is finest grade made. This is the stuff that first made Liberon's well-deserved international reputation. It's fabulous for rubbing out a shellac or varnish finish, applying waxes, and other applications like that. It's also good for polishing metals such as bronze, copper, chrome, etc. and for cleaning (with soapy water) porcelain, marble and glass. We use it for everything. The big advantage for using 0000 steel wool when applying waxes is that the wool itself doesn't absorb any wax, and 0000 steel wool also helps rub out the finish at the same time. >b>Customer Tip: Dont tear the steel wool as it creates stress on the fibers and distorts the material. Use a scissor and cut th ematerial in the desired sections. Tip: Don't rip chunks of steel wool from a roll. That stresses the fibers and breaks them so they don't last as long. Use a scissors and cut off the required piece. Tip: Don't rip chunks of steel wool from a roll. That stresses the fibers and breaks them so they don't last as long.

Inversion Table, featured on TV, is the most popular model from the Teeter Hang Ups ComforTrak Series and includes optional accessories to modify your inversion experience for whatever stretch your body is craving. Whether youare in the mood for a relaxing shiatsu-style massage, or needing to focus traction on your lower back, the EP-560 Ltd. has all the right accessories to provide stress relief for your target areas. Imagine being able to use a back stretcher for just minutes a day, in your own home, for natural pain relief, helping to temporarily relieve back pain by stretching and relaxing muscles, decompressing the spine, and even building core strength through inverted exercise.

The structure of down allows air to be trapped between its filaments and warmed by body heat to provide insulation for the user. Through use, dirt and body oils build up on down items. This affects both the fabric and the down fill. Dirt attracts water; if the fabric absorbs water, rain and condensation can easily transfer into the down. If down gets wet it clumps together. This causes it to lose loft and insulation as it cant trap air effectively. When wet, down loses all of its insulating properties, as water conducts heat away from the body up to 25 times faster than air. It will also gain weight and its breathability will be significantly reduced; leaving you feeling cold, wet and uncomfortable. Down filled items are most likely to get sweaty and wet inside when used in damp or wet conditions. Therefore it is important to stop down filled gear from getting wet by maintaining Durable Water Repellency (DWR). The outer fabric of your down filled item, as well as the down inside, must be maintained to ensure comfort. Nikwax Down Wash Direct will revitalise the insulation and restore DWR.',\n",

Below are just a handful of excerpts from the sport\\'s greatest behind-the-scenes stories ever told, as compiled in the first-of-its-kind collection, \"Then Junior Said to Jeff...\": \"I\\'d rather not elaborate on that,\" [Dale Earnhardt Sr.] said [when addressing the media after his seventh Winston Cup championship and being asked about the earlier death of driver Neil Bonnett], then paused again. When he looked up, there was genuine pain in his face. His voice was halting when he spoke: \"I can\\'t go fishing in my own lake because of Neil,\" he said. \"Because we fished in it all the time. I can\\'t. . . . I\\'ve tried. . . . It\\'s Neil\\'s pond.\" Track promoter Enoch Staley recalls a race on Junior Johnson\\'s home track of North Wilkesboro Speedway: \"I saw something sail out of the stands and over the fence, right in front of [Johnson\\'s opponent\\'s] car. It hit the track and broke into a thousand pieces. It was a quart-sized fruit jar filled with white liquor.',\n",

Bringing together Chinese and European expertise on the Sino-European Security relationship , this book positions Europe - both the EU and the major national actors - and China in a global security context. It offers not merely an elaboration of the theme of bilateral security relations, but also introduces a wider view on Europe and China as global security actors. The chapters cover four main themes: the perceptions of and actual relations between Europe and China as security actors; relations of China and Europe with third parties such as the US, Russia, and Iran; Europe and China as actors in multilateral security approaches; Europe and China as (potential) security actors in each others technological domain or region. Given the increasingly prominent roles that both China and Europe play in international security as permanent members of the UN Security Council (in the European case, through the informal and partial representation of the UK and France), through their extensive global economic interests, and their important relations with the USA, this book provides a timely examination of the current state and future developments in the Sino-European relationship. This book will be of much interest to students of international security, Chinese politics, EU studies and IR in general.',\n",
